This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{install.packages("readr")}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

spotify_data <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\danie\\Desktop\\2do AÃ±o\\UNIT 24 - ADVANCED PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYSIS\\Spotify Most Streamed Songs.csv")

spotify_data$release_date <- as.Date(paste(spotify_data$released_year, spotify_data$released_month, spotify_data$released_day, sep = "-"))

spotify_data$released_year <- NULL
spotify_data$released_month <- NULL
spotify_data$released_day <- NULL

head(spotify_data)
View(spotify_data)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
